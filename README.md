# Goals
When making NA Connect, we focused on sticking to the theme of bringing the community together and engaging them. Our main goal with builiding NA Connect was to give people opporunities to do things that require more than one person. For example, in the NA community, there are many tennis players. However, it is vey difficult to practice tennis alone, but it is also hard to find people to play with. Our website specializes in helping people gather and engage with eachother, and can help two tennis players who would have otherwise been unable to play and practice get together and achieve a mutual goal. Regardless of the need, NA Connect serves as a link between people in our community, bringing all kinds of people together.

# How it works
When a user enters the website, the first thing they are faced with is a greeting, and a place to enter their name. Afterwards, they will gain access to the forum itself, where they can either view existing posts or create a new one. Each post will have a thread that the poster can assign. At the top of the screen will be buttons that the user can use to jump to a specific topic. For example, if the user wanted to find someone to play tennis with, they would make a post with the thread topic of "tennis". Afterwards, anyone else who uses the site would see a button at the top of the screen that would bring them to the post about tennis, at which point they could make a response and get together with the other person.

# About
